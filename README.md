# Advent of Code 23
This repo contains my solutions of the 2023 [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/). <br>
I got inspired by the youtube channel LowLevelLearning and decided to rotate my solutions between 3 languages: C, Python and C++. <br>
So i will start with C and then rotate through the 3 in the order mentioned above.

## ðŸ›  Usage
I only put the source code and the inputs here, so to run the programs you have to compile them inside the `src` folder and then execute them. <br>
### For C:
```
gcc dayX.c
./a.out
```
### For Python: 
```
python dayX.py
or
./dayX.py
```
### For C++:
```
g++ dayX.cpp
./a.out
```
Hope you like them and if you have any tips let me know :)
